## In-Class

We made a quick Whatsapp app using:
- Arrays (for storing a list of contacts)
- JSON (for storing lots of info like name, phone number, time, first sentence of text, number of unread, etc about messages)
- loops to show the list of messages

---

## Next Class
- We will see how to use JS Decisions for this: if the contact is not saved, show phone number, else show the contact name in the message
